# BRAIN

This section relates to BRAIN component, the service that coordinates the event messages, subscribes to the "salesorder/created" topic, and publishes event messages to the "Internal/Charityfund/Increased" topic, and is represented by the "BRAIN" block in the whiteboard diagram.

## Overview

The brain is a basic CAP application with two of the three layers in use. In effect, a "service" more than an application:

|Layer|Description|
|-|-|
|`app`|Unused|
|`srv`|A single service `teched` is defined exposing an entity `CharityEntry`. Custom JavaScript code for managing the Brain's operations and activities|
|`db`|An entity `CharityEntry` is defined with a `SoldToParty` property as key, and a counter property. This entity is defined within the namespace `charity`|

The service, once deployed, does not require any human intervention to function. Processing follows a sequence of the following activities, each time an event published to the "salesorder/created" topic on the messaging bus is received; each activity is denoted by a "level" number (1 through 4):

1. Log the message details
1. Retrieve sales order header details from the OData service `API_SALES_ORDER_SRV` proxied by the SANDBOX component
1. Request a conversion of the total net amount of the sales order to the equivalent in charity fund credits, by calling the CONVERTER component\*
1. Publish a new event to the "Internal/Charityfund/Increased" topic

_\*This is as long as sold-to party is one that hasn't already been processed 10 times before_

##Â Controlling the processing

To aid testing and gradual component deployment (getting all components up and running and connected), an enhancement has been made since the Developer Keynote presentation to allow the control of these activities using an environment variable `BRAIN_LEVEL`.

Setting this to 0 will mean that none of the above activities are carried out. Setting this to a value equivalent to one of the activity numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 or 4) will mean that activities up to and including that number will be carried out. The default value (if none is set explicitly) is 1, meaning the received event message will be logged, and that's all.


## Remote services defined and used

In carrying out the activities listed above, the CAP service consumes the following services which are defined in `package.json`. Some of these employ destinations defined in the cloud (on CF - see below):

|Name|Kind|Details|
|-|-|-|
|`messaging`|`enterprise-messaging`|Connection to the message bus|
|`db`|`sqlite`|Local persistence|
|`S4SalesOrders`|`odata`|Connection to the API Hub sandbox (SAP S/4HANA Cloud mock system) OData service. Destination `apihub_mock_salesorders`|
|`ConversionService`|`rest`|Connection to the Converter (Go microservice) conversion service. Destination `charityfund_converter`|


## Running it

Like for example the [SANDBOX](../../s4hana/sandbox), you can get this component up and running at different levels - locally, on CF and on Kyma.


### Locally

It's straightforward to run CAP applications and services locally, but when they have connections to cloud-based services, connection and credential information is required, and traditionally stored in a file called `default-env.json`. Because of what this contains, it is not normally included in any repository for security reasons, so you should [create this yourself now](default-env.md).




The CAP service has been deployed to the collab CF org/space 9e079cc4trial/dev as app [`brain`](brain.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com) and has bindings to the following service instances in that same space:

|Name|Service|
|-|-|
|`destination-lite`|Destination service instance with 'lite' plan, to enable the CAP service to access destinations|
|`emdev`|Enterprise Messaging service instance with 'dev' plan (note this is a deprecated plan but the only one available in trial)|
|`xsuaa-application`|Auth & Trust Management service instance with 'application' plan, to enable the CAP service to access the other instances|

Deployment was done using `cf push` (rather than an MTA based deployment) followed by manual binding (`cf bind-service`) to these existing services.

## On Kyma

The CAP service has been deployed to the default namesapce as app [`brain`](brain.c210ab1.kyma.shoot.live.k8s-hana.ondemand.com) and has bindings to the following service instances in that same space:

|Name|Service|
|-|-|
|`destination-lite`|Destination service instance with 'lite' plan, to enable the CAP service to access destinations|
|`emdev`|Enterprise Messaging service instance with 'dev' plan (note this is a deprecated plan but the only one available in trial)|
|`xsuaa-application`|Auth & Trust Management service instance with 'application' plan, to enable the CAP service to access the other instances|

Deployment was done using the following steps:
1. Create a secret for docker deployment from Github

``` shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=https://docker.pkg.github.com --docker-username=<Github.com User> --docker-password=<Github password or token> --docker-email=<github email>
```

2. Create a file named secret.yaml and supply the VCAP_SERVICES for service bindings as such
``` yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: appconfigcap
data:
  VCAP_SERVICES: |
  { "content_here" }
```

3. Run [k8s_deploy](./k8s_deploy)

4. Return to the Kyma Console and the API Rules. You should see a new API Rule named brain and the URL for this endpoint.

## Local execution

A `default-env.json` file is available (not in the repo) for local execution. Run from the CAP service directory with `cds run`.
